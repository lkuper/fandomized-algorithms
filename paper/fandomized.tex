\begin{abstract}
We introduce the concepts of \emph{fandomness} and fandomized algorithms,
discuss some of their applications, and demonstrate a practical fandom number
generator.

\section{Introduction}
Fandomized algorithms make use of fandom numbers and fentropy to perform
useful, or at least emotionally satisfying, computation.

\emph{Fandomness} is ...

Here we discuss some of the most prominent applications for fandomized
algorithms...

... we hope to disseminate these ideas more broadly within computing...

\section{Fandomness and fandom variables}
A \emph{fandom variable} can take on a \emph{fandom number}, but the generation
of fandom numbers requires a source of \emph{fentropy}. Thankfully, there exist
fentropic processes in nature \emph{Fentropy} is a measure of the fannishness
of a fandom variable over time.  Computing the fentropy of a fandom variable
exactly is in general MLP-Hard, although approximations are possible.  The
world's technological capacity to store and communicate fentropic information
has increased since the advent of the information age, especially since
Dreamwidth launched.

\section{OTPs}
OTPs are one of the most important applications of fandom numbers.  An
OTP is when you put a character together with another character from a
secret fandom pad, the one with whom it truly belongs (mod 26).  The
true love of an OTP has been proven to be impossible to break.

\section{Markov fandom fields}
We may also wish to do inference over communities of interacting fandom
variables using a Markov fandom field and the \emph{headcanon propagation}
algorithm, although it is MLP-hard in most cases.  However, we can perform
approximate inference with loopy headcanon propagation.  Fandom-wanking is not
guaranteed to terminate in this case, and a consistent community-wide headcanon
may not emerge.\footnote{The alert reader may have noticed that Tumblr is a
platform for human computation \cite{luisvonahn}, performing loopy headcanon
propagation at scale. Most Tumblr traffic is used for applications in protein
folding and computational geophysics.}

\section{A practical fandom number generator}
We have developed a practical algorithm and implementation\footnote{
\url{http://github.com/lkuper/fandomized-algorithms}} for
generating fandom numbers, a key component for any fandomized
algorithm. A naturally occurring source of fentropy, Archive of Our
Own\footnote{Google for ``archive of our own"; do you not know how to
  do web searches?\footnotemark}
\footnotetext{Oh, fine.  It's \cite{ao3}.}, supplies an
ever-increasing amount of fandomness, certainly more than the current
global demand for fentropy to power fandomized algorithms. As
fandomized algorithms become more broadly deployed, further sources of
fandomness may be required -- we may have to mine THE DARK
SOCIAL\footnote{THE DARK SOCIAL} -- but we will burn that bridge when
we get to it.

Our practical fandom number generator downloads a pseudo-fandomly-selected
transformative work from AOOO, locates all of the base-10 numbers in it, and
then returns one of them at fandom. If for some reason there are no fandom
numbers present in a given transformative work, we simply try another
transformative work until we find one.

This work would not be canon without the public availability of sources of
fentropy; the open publishing and reuse rights of the transformative works on
AOOO enable us to produce our own transformative works.

\section{Outro}
As the dictum about software development goes, ``shipping code wins". We have
accepted this headcanon, but we realize that many ponies in the computer
science community remain squicked by it.

As such, we have provided an overview of \emph{fandomized algorithms},
\emph{fandomness}, and \emph{fandom variables}, and explored some of their
applications in computing. In upcoming seasons, we expect that it will be
revealed that fandom/CS is the OTP.
