\begin{abstract}
We introduce the concept of \emph{fandomness} and of fandomized algorithms, and
demonstrate their application in a practical fandom number generator.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
As the dictum about software development goes, ``shipping code wins". We have
accepted this idea as headcannon, but we realize that large portions
(fandoms?) in the computer science community remain squicked by it.

As such, we wish to provide a survey of the current work in fandomized
algorithms and the associated formalisms; in upcoming seasons, we expect that
it will be revealed that fandom and computer science are the OTP.

Introduce the notion of \emph{fandomness} ...

A \emph{fandom variable} can take on a \emph{fandom number}, but discovering
these fandom numbers requires a source of \emph{fentropy}. Thankfully there
exist highly fentropic processes in nature; we can usually sample from them
over the Internet.

We may also wish to do inference over collections (cliques of fans? is there a
good term for this? XXX needs work...) of interacting fandom variables using a
Markov Fandom Field via \emph{headcannon propagation} (pun on Judea Pearl
somehow here), although it is intractable in many cases.
- but we can perform approximate optimization with loopy headcannon
  propagation; fandom-wanking is not guaranteed to terminate in this case, and
  a consistent community(XXX: better term)-wide headcannon may not
  emerge.\footnote{The alert reader may have noticed that Tumblr is a platform
  for human-computation (XXX: cite Luis von Ahn), performing
  loopy headcannon propagation at scale. Most Tumblr traffic is used for
  applications in protein folding and computational geology.}

\section{A practical fandom number generator}
We have developed a practical algorithm and implementation for
generating fandom numbers, a key component for any fandomized
algorithm. A naturally occurring source of fentropy, Archive of Our
Own\footnote{Google for ``archive of our own"; do you not know how to
  do web searches?\footnotemark}
\footnotetext{Oh, fine.  It's \cite{ao3}.}, supplies an
ever-increasing amount of fandomness, certainly more than the current
global demand for fentropy to power fandomized algorithms. As
fandomized algorithms become more broadly deployed, further sources of
fandomness may be required -- we may have to mine THE DARK
SOCIAL\footnote{THE DARK SOCIAL} -- but we will burn that bridge when
we get to it.

Right. Yes.

Our practical fandom number generator downloads a pseudo-fandomly-selected
transformative work from AOOO, locates all of the base-10 numbers in it, and
then returns one of them at fandom. If for some reason there are no fandom
numbers present in a given transformative work, we simply try the next
transformative work until we find one.
%% XXX: alexr doesn't really like this sentence
(These numbers, having been used by fannish domain experts in a transformative
work on AO3, are guaranteed by definition to have high fentropy.)

This work would not be canon without the public availability of sources of
fentropy; the open publishing and reuse rights of the transformative works on
AO3 enable us to produce our own transformative works. Of course, we could use
a different source of fentropy, such as the AO3 splinter site arXiv, which is
popular for for Physics, also known as the neutrino fandom.

\section{Further Applications of Fandomized Algorithms}

\subsection{OTPs}

OTPs are one of the most important applications of fandom numbers.  To
use an OTP, you put a character together with a character from a
secret fandom pad that it truly loves and with whom it truly belongs
(mod 26).  The true love of an OTP has been proven to be impossible to
break.

\section{Fentropy}

Fentropy is a measure of the fannishness of a fandom variable. Computing the
fentropy of a fandom variable exactly is in general MLP-Hard, although
approximations are possible.

The world's technological capacity to store and communicate fentropic
information has increased since the advent of the information age,
especially since Dreamwidth launched.

Unfortunately, if fentropy increases until all fenergy is equally
distributed, it will eventually cause the heat death of the Jossverse.
