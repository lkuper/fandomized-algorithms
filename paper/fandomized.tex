\section{alexr writing things}
As the dictum about software development goes, ``shipping code wins". We have
integrated this advice into our headcannon, but we realize that large portions
(fandoms?) in the computer science community remain blissfully unaware (how do
you say "doesn't share that headcannon?") ...
As such, we wish to provide a survey of the current work in fandomized
algorithms and the required formalisms; going forward, it may become clear that
fandom theory (XXX; something about transformational works) and computer
science are the OTP.

Introduce the notion of \emph{fandomness} ...

A \emph{fandom variable} can take on a \emph{fandom number}, but discovering
these fandom numbers requires a source of \emph{fentropy}. Thankfully there
exist highly fentropic processes in nature; we can usually sample from them
over the Internet.

Given a set of fandom variables, we can compute their fentropy as a function of
... although doing so is MLP-hard.

We may wish to do inference over collections (cliques of fans? is there a good
term for this? XXX needs work...) of interacting fandom variables using a
Markov Fandom Field; 
- exact inference with headcannon propagation may be intractable
- but we can perform approximate optimization with loopy headcannon
  propagation; fandom-wanking is not guaranteed to terminate in this case, and
  a consistent community(XXX: better term)-wide headcannon may not emerge.

\section{A practical fandom number generator}
We have developed a practical algorithm and implementation for
generating fandom numbers, a key component for any fandomized
algorithm. A naturally occurring source of fentropy, Archive of Our
Own\footnote{Google for ``archive of our own"; do you not know how to
  do web searches?\footnotemark}
\footnotetext{Oh, fine.  It's \cite{ao3}.}, supplies an
ever-increasing amount of fandomness, certainly more than the current
global demand for fentropy to power fandomized algorithms. As
fandomized algorithms become more broadly deployed, further sources of
fandomness may be required -- we may have to mine THE DARK
SOCIAL\footnote{THE DARK SOCIAL} -- but we will burn that bridge when
we get to it.

Right. Yes.

Our practical fandom number generator downloads a transformative work from
AOOO, locates all of the base-10 numbers in it, and then returns one of them at
fandom. These numbers, having been used by fannish domain experts in a
transformative work on AO3, are guaranteed by definition to have high fentropy.

Write something about text mining and how important it is for OA publishing in
free repositories like AO3 and the splinter site arXiv (for Physics, aka the
neutrino fandom) to allow transformative works of transformative works.  

\section{alexr writing things}
In future work, we could adapt our fandom number generator to accept other
sources of fandomness, including arXiv.

Also we could pun harder on transformative works and maybe transformational
grammar? Transformative grammar?

Fandomized algorithms could be used for generating maximum-entropy OTPs.

\section{Applications}

\subsection{OTPs}

OTPs are one of the most important applications of fandom numbers.  To
use an OTP, you put a character together with a character from a
secret fandom pad that it truly loves and with whom it truly belongs
(mod 26).  The true love of an OTP has been proven to be impossible to
break.

\section{Fentropy}

Fentropy is a measure of the fannishness of a fandom variable.

The world's technological capacity to store and communicate fentropic
information has increased since the advent of the information age,
especially since Dreamwidth launched.

Unfortunately, if fentropy increases until all fenergy is equally
distributed, it will eventually cause the heat death of the Jossverse.
